## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

### Backend
- Python
- FastAPI

### Database
- Generated synthetic data using Python (train_ocr.py)

### Model Training

- Kaggle (platform for training)

## Currently: 
- Trying to use CRNN instead of SVTR
- Using 20k data to train the model


## Logs
Model training failed 3 times
- SVTR: training worked out fine but after connecting to project it does not work
    - Might be too precise or trained incorrectly
- Too less data: If less than 20k the accuracy may be too low
